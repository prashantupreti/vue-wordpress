# vue-wordpress

## Description
What are we really doing here? This is a test application I made for Headless CMS with Wordpress REST Api and Vue-cli. It helps one to work with frontend and backend at the same time. I am using tailwindcss as the front-end design framework with vuejs and wordpress is in the backend.  


## Requirements
1. Nodejs installed
2. npm installed
3. Download a package of wordpress and extract it on your local php server
4. Configure all the database
5. We will fetch the data from those posts you make in your wordpress application
